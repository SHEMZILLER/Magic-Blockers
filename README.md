Platform: Godot Engine (Desktop)

Overview: Magic Blockers is a 1v1 fighting game where Player 1 (Knight) and Player 2 (Mage) battle using melee attacks, blocks, and jumps. The game integrates with Solana devnet for on-chain achievements and rankings via MagicBlock.

General Information

Players: The game supports two players in a local multiplayer setup.

Player 1: Knight (controlled using WASD and other keys).



Player 2: Mage (controlled using arrow keys and other keys).


Objective: Defeat your opponent by reducing their health to zero through attacks while avoiding damage by blocking or dodging.



Health: Each player starts with 1000 health points. The game ends when one player’s health reaches zero, and the winner is recorded on-chain via MagicBlock.
